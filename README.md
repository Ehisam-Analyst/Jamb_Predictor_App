# 🎯 JAMB Performance Predictor (3MTT Knowledge Showcase Project)

This is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts a student's likely performance in the **JAMB examination** before the exam, based on key academic and socioeconomic indicators. It is built as a community-impact project under the **3MTT Program** – Data Analysis & Visualization track.

## 🚀 Project Objective

To provide an intelligent, AI-driven tool that helps:
- Students assess their readiness for JAMB.
- Educators identify at-risk learners early.
- Policymakers understand patterns in educational outcomes.

This project uses data such as:
- School type
- Socioeconomic status
- Number of retakes
- Parental involvement
- IT knowledge
- Assignment habits

## 🧠 How It Works

Using a trained regression model (like Linear Regression), the app:
1. Accepts student background inputs.
2. Encodes and preprocesses them.
3. Predicts the expected JAMB score out of 400.
4. Suggests areas for improvement.
